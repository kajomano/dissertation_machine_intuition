This thesis would have not been possible without the support I received from many individuals.

First of all I would like to thank Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Georg Carle for giving me the opportunity to join the Chair for Network Architectures and Services and for supervising the dissertation. I also would like to thank XYZ for being my second assessor and XYZ for chairing the examination committee.
